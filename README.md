# Pokemon-Simulator
My Pokémon Battle Simulator! With an easy-to-use, text based interface, this Python battle simulator allows users to get a taste of that classic Nintendo nostalgia. A battle sim complete with friendship, customizable move sets, accurate type advantages, and a team randomizer to play millions of unique battles!

## Current Work:
- Creation of all_pokemon list.
- Planning to add training, friendship, and changeable move sets.
